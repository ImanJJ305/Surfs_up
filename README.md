# Surfs Up Analysis
## Overview of Project

###Purpose
    The purpose of this analysis was to assist potential investors of the Surf and Shake Shop in determining that opening a store front in Awahoo, Hawaii will provide them with a great return. We've analyzed weather patern data from this specific island to prove that the weather is often optimal and will not deter foot traffic to the location.   

## Results

### Major Points Found From The Analysis
    - Based on this analysis we've determined that the weather is fairly consistant betwseen June and December on this island with the average temperature in June being 74 degrees and the average temperature in December being 71 degrees. 
    - The standard deviation for the two months is fairly high at above 3 for the two. This means that the temperature ranges and is quit spread from the average previously mentioned. So we aren't going to consistantly going to get temperature in the 70s. 
    - The minimum recorded temperature for the month of June is 64 degrees. This is something that the investors may want to take into consideration is this isn't expected for the summer time and may affect ice cream sales.
 
    
## Summary
    Investors in Surf and Shake Shops will need to not only consider the temperatures on this island but also, rain patterns, natural disaster (hurricane) patterns, and other things that will affect the ability to aquire a worth while return from their contribution as this current analysis does not provide enough well reounded information on the potential of this venture.
